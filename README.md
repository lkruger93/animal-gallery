# cpnt262-a3
the course title for this is cpnt 262!  the author name is Lauren Kruger!
this was a super wild project where i actually had to type more than two lines of codes.  it was quite difficult in figuring out exactly what needed to be done but once i got it figured out things were pretty straightforward.

the link to my github repo is https://github.com/lkruger93/cpnt262-a3.git
the link to my heroku app is https://animalgallery93.herokuapp.com/

i can likely attribute much of the code to the fact that i watched it happen during class!  i am happy that this happened!  i am also happy i figured out port things and more!
